Snake and Ladder

This is a simple terminal snake & ladder game. I tried my best to write code with good-readability and learned many things from it.

Few basic concepts used in this code are:
- Dictionary
- List
- Generating random number
- Selecting a Random value from a list
- Adding wait/sleep in program
- Conditional Statements i.e. IF and ELSE
- Getting input from user

What is happening in Game:
1- Display the welcome message
2- Collect the player's names
3- Until one of the player wins do the following:
3.1- Roll the dice
3.2- Move the player forward for the value got on the dice roll.
3.3- If the player is on snake's head, move down to its tail
3.4- If the player is on ladder's bottom, take it to its top
3.5- else remain there and let the second player roll the dice

Run the game using command python3 snakeandladder.py.
